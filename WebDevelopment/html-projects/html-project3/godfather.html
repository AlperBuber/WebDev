    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      Directed by Francis Ford Coppola | Based on Mario Puzo’s novel The
      Corleone family, one of New York’s most powerful mafia families, is led by
      Don Vito Corleone. His youngest son, Michael Corleone, a World War II
      hero, initially wants no part in the family business. However, when a
      rival gangster, Virgil "The Turk" Sollozzo, attempts to assassinate Vito
      after his request for protection in drug dealings is rejected, Michael is
      pulled into the underworld. Michael takes revenge by killing Sollozzo and
      a corrupt police captain, Mark McCluskey, forcing him to flee to Sicily.
      During his exile, he marries a local woman, Apollonia, but she is killed
      in a car bombing meant for him. Meanwhile, back in the U.S., Vito recovers
      and negotiates peace among the Five Families, but his eldest son, Sonny,
      is brutally gunned down. Michael returns home after Vito arranges his safe
      passage, taking over the family after Vito’s death. He orchestrates a
      ruthless series of assassinations against rival mafia heads, solidifying
      his power. In one chilling sequence, while standing as godfather at his
      nephew’s baptism, Michael orders the simultaneous executions of his
      enemies. His transformation into a ruthless mob boss is complete when he
      has his sister Connie’s husband, Carlo, killed for his betrayal. When
      Connie confronts Michael, his wife, Kay, watches in horror as Michael lies
      about the murder, and the door to his office is ominously closed in her
      face. Michael has become the new Godfather, fully embracing the role he
      once rejected.
