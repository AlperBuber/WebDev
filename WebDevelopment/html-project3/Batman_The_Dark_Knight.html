    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      Directed by Christopher Nolan | Sequel to "Batman Begins" (2005) Gotham
      City is experiencing a decline in organized crime thanks to Batman,
      District Attorney Harvey Dent, and Lieutenant Jim Gordon. However, a new,
      chaotic villain known as the Joker emerges, upending Gotham’s fragile
      sense of order. The Joker begins a campaign of terror, robbing banks and
      assassinating key officials while pushing Batman to his moral limits. He
      orchestrates a devastating attack that kills Gotham’s police commissioner
      and a judge. When he targets Harvey Dent, Bruce Wayne’s childhood love,
      Rachel Dawes, is also put at risk. Bruce considers revealing his identity
      as Batman, but Harvey pretends to be Batman to draw out the Joker.
      However, Joker attacks and captures both Harvey and Rachel, placing them
      in separate locations rigged with explosives. Batman tries to save Rachel
      but is misled by the Joker; instead, he finds Harvey, who survives but is
      horribly disfigured, becoming Two-Face
