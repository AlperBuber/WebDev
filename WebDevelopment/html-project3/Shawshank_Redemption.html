    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      Directed by Frank Darabont | Based on Stephen King's novella "Rita
      Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption" Andy Dufresne, a successful banker, is
      wrongly convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. Sentenced to two
      consecutive life terms at Shawshank State Penitentiary, he must endure the
      harsh realities of prison life. At first, Andy keeps to himself, but over
      time, he befriends Ellis "Red" Redding, a longtime inmate and smuggler.
      Despite the brutal conditions, Andy maintains his composure and
      intelligence. He gains the trust of Warden Samuel Norton and the corrupt
      prison guards by helping them launder money under the alias "Randall
      Stephens." In return, Andy is allowed to improve the prison library and
      help fellow inmates earn their GEDs. However, when a new inmate, Tommy
      Williams, arrives with evidence that could prove Andy’s innocence, the
      warden has him killed to keep Andy under his control. Realizing he will
      never be freed legally, Andy meticulously carries out a secret escape plan
      over 19 years. He digs a tunnel through his cell wall using a rock hammer,
      hiding the hole behind a poster of Rita Hayworth (later replaced by
      Marilyn Monroe and Raquel Welch). On a stormy night, he crawls through a
      sewage pipe and emerges free. Before escaping, Andy exposes the warden’s
      money-laundering scheme by sending incriminating evidence to a newspaper.
      The warden, fearing exposure, commits suicide. Red, paroled after 40
      years, follows Andy’s instructions to find a buried box containing money
      and a letter inviting him to join Andy in Zihuatanejo, Mexico. The film
      ends with Red joyfully reuniting with his friend on the beach, symbolizing
      hope and redemption.
